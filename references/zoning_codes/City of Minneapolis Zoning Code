notes

base structure of the Minneapolis Zoning code

1) use requirements

2) base districts: allowed uses within a district

3) overlay districts: control built form

OZFS functionality implications
- constraints (e.g. FAR) are a function of bulk type** - test this further
- variances to spatially resolved constraints based on bulk type & # of units
