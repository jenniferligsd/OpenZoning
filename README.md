# Open Zoning Feed Spefication Project.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a data standard for 
zoning codes so that zoning data can be easily digitized in a machine-
readable format to allow for multi-jurisdictional analysis and integration
into third-party applications.

## Precedents and related work

[Sara Bronin](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/sara-bronin){target="_blank"} is 
leading an effort to assemble a 
[national zoning atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/){target="_blank"}. Our goal
is to create a tool that can easily convert the data she and her collaborators 
are collecting in to the data standard that we are developing.

The Metropolitan Area Planning Council ([MAPC](https://www.mapc.org/){target="_blank"})
has assembled an open-source [zoning atlas](https://zoningatlas.mapc.org/){target="_blank"} 
for the Boston Metropolitan Area. We are using their data to test our initial 
hypotheses about the most flexible and efficient data formats and data governance models.
