# Open Zoning Feed Specification Project.

The purpose of this project is to develop a data standard for
zoning codes so that zoning data can be easily digitized in a machine-
readable format to allow for multi-jurisdictional analysis and ingestion/integration
into third-party applications.

### \#Rant
Zoning as it currently exists in the U.S. is _ridiculous_...
Answering basic questions about what can be built, current structures' compliance, and overall impacts of existing and proposed changes to zoning are impossible to answer accurately without detailed legal analyses.

3. [Precedents and related work](#precedents-and-related-work)
4. [Potential research questions](#potential-research-questions)

## Mission, vision, goals
- Allow _non-experts_ and _"machines"_ to know & understand **what can be built** on a property or in a region
- Able to store zoning regulations as written, without interpretation (i.e. don't store an FAR value if there isn't one in the code)
- A data architecture flexible enough to accommodate most types of zoning regulations & regimes
- Versioning systems for both the data standard and zoning codes that allow for iteration, improvement, maintenance
- Planning and issue tracking systems for short- through long-term planning
- Governance and practices that ensure continued access and relevance, so that OZFS avoids becoming orphaned or stale

### Old
> Open Zoningâ€™s mission is _to empower the nation with the knowledge of zoning_.
> towards the vision of
>
> * a zoning system heavily influenced by and that works directly for the communities it most impacts;
> * a new class of developers with diverse development value systems that enable new, community-centered design potentials in the (re)filling of American urban areas; and
> * integrated transportation and housing development at the city, state, and national scales

## Anticipated OZFS Components

### Geospatial structure
Expectation is for multiple GIS layers to be uploaded (e.g. base + overlay districts)
Those will be merge into a single zoning layer that _atomizes_ each polygon into a single zoning district (or combination of districts)
Stored in `GeoJSON` or other open/accessible GIS format

### (Zoning) Data structure & rules engine
Non-tabular data structure, enabling flexible definition & storage of zoning regs.
Zoning map accesses via a lookup key(s) of municipality + district (e.g. `MA-Suff-BOS-SPA-ZR4B` (not an actual district!))
Stored in `JSON` or equivalent

### Translation service
Script(s) for converting from other zoning data standards (see [below](#regionalstate-wide-zoning-atlases))

### UI/UX
Simplified/standardized UI for entering and defining zoning constraints

### _Future_

#### Automated Zoning Code creation
Perhaps based on [PlaceCode](https://www.principle.us/placecode)

#### Existing built environment dataset(s)
To enable:
- zoning additions and modifications to current structures on a parcel
- zoning regulations based on relations to adjacent lots/buildings
Potential sources: OSM, [Regrid](https://regrid.com/buildings)

#### _Interpreted_ Zoning Rules
E.g.
- Realizable units based on lot characteristics
- FAR/floor area based on other regulations
- Parking requirements with max build out

## The Future with OZFS
We hypothesize that wide-scale adoption of the OZFS will lead to many valuable real-world outcomes:
- Enabling wide-scale upzoning
- Automating ADU siting & approval
- Supporting affordable housing development
- Facilitating improved community engagement/scenario planning
- Lowering development costs overall
- Empowering small developers/individual property owners
- Lining up policy goals with actual zoning regulations

## Precedents and related work
### Regional/State-wide Zoning Atlases
[Sara Bronin](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/sara-bronin) is leading an effort to assemble a
[national zoning atlas](https://www.zoningatlas.org/). They have completed
a zoning atlas of [Connecticut](https://www.zoningatlas.org/connecticut)
(including 178 municipalities) with an interactive website that allows users
to filter zoning districts based on permitted residential uses, minimum lot
sizes, and occupancy restrictions. The Connecticut atlas does not have data
available for download. Other projects affiliated with the National Zoning Atlas
are underway in California, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Montana, New York, and Ohio.

The Metropolitan Area Planning Council ([MAPC](https://www.mapc.org/))
has assembled an open-source [zoning atlas](https://zoningatlas.mapc.org/)
for the Boston Metropolitan Area, including 101 municipalities. Their data is freely
available for download as shapefiles including zoning attributes. We are using
their data to test our initial hypotheses about the most flexible and efficient
data formats and data governance models. Our initial visualization of MAPC
zones is [here](https://urban-stack.github.io/OpenZoning/MAPC-files/MAPC-map_leaflet.html).

### Individual City Interactive Zoning Maps
- [New York City](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/)
- [Chicago](https://secondcityzoning.org/) from https://derekeder.com/
- [Atlanta](https://sites.gatech.edu/atlzoningexplorer/atl-zoning-code-explorer/) from Mark Schwabacher of Georgia Tech's Center for Spatial Planning Analytics and Visualization ([CSPAV](https://cspav.gatech.edu/)). The tool allows users to interactively explore a map, search for locations where specific uses are permitted, and export data on dimensional requirements for use-specified zones. It does not allow users to download geospatial data with zoning attributes attached.

### Data Standard Precedents
- [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) - created by Google (with/for TriMet) to enable transit trip planning. Now owned/managed by [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/)
- [GBFS](https://gbfs.mobilitydata.org/)
- [MDS](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/) - created by Ellis Associates for LA DOT. OMF was created to manage it
- [CDS](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-cds/) - Curb data specification - created by OMF working group (OMF's first non-MDS effort)
- [OpenLR](http://www.openlr.org/) - common standard for positioning along curb (from TomTom?)

### UI/UX Precedents
- [StreetMix](https://streetmix.net/)
- [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)

## Potential research questions

1. *MBTA Communities:* In January 2021, the Massachusetts legislature passed an
[economic development bill](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter358)
requiring [communities served by MBTA](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multi-family-zoning-requirement-for-mbta-communities#what-is-an-%22mbta-community%22?-) to zone at least one district permitting
multifamily housing within one half-mile of a transit stop. The law specifies
the minimum number of multifamily units each community must allow, based on
its type of MBTA service and its existing number of housing units. Our data
allow us to analyze how much the changes resulting from this and similar laws
could increase housing supply and regional spatial accessibility.

2. *Small-scale housing:* This dataset would allow for the development of an
interactive web-based application that would allow developers to identify
parcels for small-scale housing developments (1-4 units).

### Potential future personas
1. Affordable housing developer (trying to repeat a structure/model in the region)
2. Community meeting with real-time scenario planning (alternative: in-person AR experience) that generates "zoning" on-the-fly
3. Modular ADU fabricator that wants to start building _on top_ of existing structures
4. ?
