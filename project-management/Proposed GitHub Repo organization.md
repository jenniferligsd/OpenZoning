front page “buckets” & nesting

- rules standard
    - tests
        - OZFS_rules_working file
        - jsons w/ version control + commenting
    - readme
    - schema (are schema and readme the same things?)
    - graphic aids for understanding
- geospatial standard
- translation code (should we have one of these each under the two “standard” buckets?)
- UI/UX
- back-end (this is just a placeholder to remind me that a big component of this will be data storage)
- project background
- references
    - info. on precedent org.s
        - MAPC-files
    - zoning codes
    - value prop case studies
- project management

I'm not sure where a folder like "images" is best located

general suggestions
- adding product labels to our issues
    - e.g. rules-standard, geo-standard, UI/UX
